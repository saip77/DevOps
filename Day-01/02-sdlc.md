## Software Development Life Cycle
- The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a framework for software development that outlines the steps involved in developing software.

## SDLC Phases
1. Requirements Gathering: The development team works with stakeholders to understand the needs and expectations of the end-users.
2. Design: The development team creates a detailed plan for the software, including the architecture, database schema, and user interface.
3. Implementation: The development team writes the code and integrates it with the design.
4. Testing: The development team tests the software to ensure it meets the requirements and works as expected.
5. Deployment: The development team deploys the software to the production environment.
6. Maintenance: The development team provides ongoing support and maintenance for the software.
