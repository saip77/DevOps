## Understanding DevOps
- DevOps is a culture and set of practices that combines Software Development **(Dev)** and Operations **(Ops)** teams to deliver software faster, more reliably, and with shared responsibility.

## DevOps Lifecycle
1. Planning: Requirements and goals are defined collaboratively.
2. Development: Code is written and managed using Version Control Systems (VCS).
3. Build: Code is compiled and packaged using automated processes.
4. Testing: Automated and manual tests ensure quality and reliability.
5. Release: Code is approved and prepared for automated deployment.
6. Deployment: Code is deployed to production using CI/CD pipelines.
7. Operations: Applications are monitored, maintained, and improved using feedback from production.
