### Understaning SDLC Life Cycle

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used in the software industry 
to plan, create, test, and deploy high-quality software

### Phases of SDLC

1. Planning: This is the initial phase where a team gathers requirements from customers and stakeholders. The goal is to understand what the customer needs and wants.

2. Defining: Once the requirements are gathered, they are clearly defined and documented. This results in a formal document like the Software Requirement Specification (SRS), which serves as a blueprint for the project.

3. Designing: In this phase, the system's architecture and design are created. This includes a high-level design (overall system architecture) and a low-level design (specific details of modules and functions).

4. Building (Developing): Developers write the application code based on the design documents. The code is then stored in a source code repository like Git.

5. Testing: Quality Assurance (QA) engineers test the software to ensure it functions correctly, meets the defined requirements, and is free of defects.

6. Deploying: After the software is tested and approved, it is promoted to the production environment, where it becomes available for customers to use.
