# Linux Flavors (Distributions)

- **What are Distros?**  
  - Linux is free → anyone can package it their way. These packages are called **distributions (distros)**.  

- **Popular Distros:**  
  - **Debian / Ubuntu:** User-friendly, stable, beginner-friendly.  
  - **Red Hat / CentOS:** Enterprise-grade, stable, server-focused.  
  - **Arch Linux:** For experts; build system piece by piece. (Meme: "I use Arch, by the way")  

- **Package Managers:**  
  - Linux “App Store” → install software securely via terminal.  
  - Examples:  
    - `apt install firefox` (Debian/Ubuntu)  
    - `pacman -S firefox` (Arch)
