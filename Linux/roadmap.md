# 🔥 Complete Linux for DevOps: 10-Phase Mastery Plan 

## 🧩 Phase 1: Linux Core Concepts 🧠
**Goal:** Understand the "what" and "why" of Linux, focusing on its foundational architecture and principles.

### ✅ Topics:
*   What is Linux? Why is it crucial for DevOps?
*   Linux vs. Unix and the open-source philosophy.
*   Linux architecture: Kernel, Shell, and Userspace.
*   Key Linux distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL).

## 🧩 Phase 2: Terminal & Shell Essentials 💻
**Goal:** Get comfortable with the command-line interface and master the most fundamental commands for navigation and file viewing.

### ✅ Topics:
*   Terminal vs. Shell and the Bash shell.
*   Basic navigation: `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`.
*   Viewing file contents: `cat`, `less`, `more`, `head`, `tail`.
*   Getting help: `man` pages and the `--help` flag.

## 🧩 Phase 3: File System Structure & Management 📂
**Goal:** Learn the Linux filesystem hierarchy and how to create, copy, and move files and directories.

### ✅ Topics:
*   Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS): `/bin`, `/etc`, `/usr`, `/var`, etc.
*   File creation and manipulation: `touch`, `echo`, `clear`.
*   Copying and moving files: `cp`, `mv`.
*   File types: regular files, directories, symlinks.

## 🧩 Phase 4: Advanced File Operations 🔨
**Goal:** Master more complex file management tasks, including linking files and performing batch operations.

### ✅ Topics:
*   Deleting files and directories: `rm`, `rmdir`.
*   Hard links vs. soft (symbolic) links: `ln`, `ln -s`.
*   Performing actions on multiple files (wildcards).
*   Viewing and comparing file content: `diff`, `tr`, `cut`.

## 🧩 Phase 5: User & Permission Management 🔑
**Goal:** Understand how Linux manages users, groups, and file permissions—a critical skill for security.

### ✅ Topics:
*   User and group concepts (root, sudo).
*   Managing users: `useradd`, `userdel`, `passwd`, `id`.
*   File permissions and ownership: `chmod`, `chown`, `chgrp`.
*   Running commands as root: `sudo`.

## 🧩 Phase 6: Advanced Searching & Text Processing 🔎
**Goal:** Become proficient in using powerful command-line tools to search for files and manipulate text data.

### ✅ Topics:
*   File searching: `find`, `locate`.
*   Text pattern matching with `grep` and `egrep`.
*   Introduction to `sed` and `awk` for stream editing.
*   Shell operators: `|`, `>`, `>>`.

## 🧩 Phase 7: Processes & System Monitoring 📈
**Goal:** Learn how to monitor a running system, manage processes, and check system resources.

### ✅ Topics:
*   Managing processes: `ps`, `top`, `htop`, `kill`.
*   System resource monitoring: `uptime`, `free`, `df`, `du`, `lsof`.
*   Archive and compression: `tar`, `gzip`, `zip`.
*   Basic process scheduling: `nice`, `renice`.

## 🧩 Phase 8: System Services & Scheduled Tasks ⏱️
**Goal:** Learn how to manage system services and automate tasks that run on a schedule.

### ✅ Topics:
*   `systemd` basics: `systemctl`, `service`, `journalctl`.
*   Enabling, starting, and stopping services.
*   Scheduled tasks: `crontab`, `at`.
*   System initialization: `init` vs. `systemd`.

## 🧩 Phase 9: Storage & Package Management 📦
**Goal:** Understand how to manage storage devices and install/update software on different Linux systems.

### ✅ Topics:
*   Package managers: `yum`, `dnf`, `rpm` (RHEL/CentOS).
*   Package managers: `apt`, `dpkg` (Debian/Ubuntu).
*   File systems: `mount`, `umount`, `fstab`, `lsblk`.
*   Introduction to LVM (Logical Volume Manager).

## 🧩 Phase 10: Security & Networking 🛡️
**Goal:** Master the tools for secure remote access and basic firewall configuration.

### ✅ Topics:
*   Secure remote access: `SSH` and `SCP`.
*   Networking tools: `ping`, `host`, `dig`, `netstat`.
*   Firewall basics: `iptables`, `firewalld`.
*   Diagnosing network issues.
